# wordlepy
python wordle utilities: word suggestions - autosolver - wordle simulator

(we called it wordlepy since pywordle was taken on pypi)

** NOTE **
wordlebot is no longer functional since the archive at:
https://www.devangthakkar.com/wordle_archive/
is no longer live (thanks to NYT)

It is left here in the hopes that we will someday be able to use it again!

## Description
The program will walk you through the steps for solving a wordle by process
of elimination. 

The *full* English language word list is loaded from "words_alpha.txt"
This was pulled from:
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt)

The frequency list was pulled from
[frequencylist.com](http://frequencylist.com)

So far, every wordle solution we've found has been present on this word list. 

*HOWEVER*

Not all wordle solutions have had a frequency associated on the frequency list here.
Because of this, we only display a words relative frequency IF it has one. 

This number should be used to help the user make good guesses (since most wordle words are semi common) (besides tacit of course. WTH was that?)
